# Data-Analytics---Quality-Cleaning

This project showcases my ability to clean and validate data as part of a larger data analytics workflow for a fictional company, Bruce, Inc. The goal was to ensure data integrity through the application of cleaning techniques, transformations, and validation processes based on a prior data profiling report. Using Excel, I removed or corrected anomalies, applied appropriate transformations, and performed data validation checks such as row count reconciliation and basic statistical analysis (MIN, MAX, AVERAGE) on key variables. The project includes a cleaned Excel file, a validation summary using a provided template, and a distribution analysis to confirm that the cleaned data remains consistent and accurate for future use. This process highlights the importance of data validation in preparing datasets for reliable analysis and integration into larger systems.
